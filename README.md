Socksicle-Win is my personal version of a Shadowsocks client for Windows, based on ss-local and CTk. I made it for myself because I didn't like other clients 🤷‍♂️.

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
4. Run the installation (create shortcut) script:
   ```bash
